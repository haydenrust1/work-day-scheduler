# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This web application seeks to make life easier for you by allowing you to plan your work day out between the hours of 9am to 5pm. Introducing the new, sleek, Work Day Scheduler! All it takes is a simple click in the clear gray box between the displayed time and save button in order to start typing out what you need to get done that day. I was tired of having a messy schedule so I figured I could organize my day by writing out the things I need to do the most during my work day. Through this application, I learned a lot about the 'this' keyword and how to apply it. I also discovered more methods in Jquery!
